# Jumper

Jumper is a game in which the player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of a secret word one at a time.

## Getting Started

---

Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and
browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.

```
python3 jumper
```

You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the
project folder. Select the main module inside the dice folder and click the "run" button.
